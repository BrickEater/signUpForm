# signUpForm

Pre Coding: So I mentioned making the structure in my last To-Do, I thought that I should break it down into the "bones, muscle, skin, and brain". The bones is the structure, the muscle is the interactionable objects, the skin is the colouring and styles, and the brain is the functions. I feel like previously I have been working outside in where I work on one thing until completion and then hope it fits with the next thing I work on. I am trying to form a workflow that works for me.
---
Thoughts: I think the way I set up the bones is making a "framework" with a unique class name so that I can apply style to it but later delete these values. From there I'll lay the website out and then replace some values.
---
To Do: Continue adding to the framework until the structure exists, then add the text fields, button, and image (the muscle), and finally, correct the colors and spacing (the skin).

I struggled to fit a very large image into the sidebar of the page. I wanted it to take up the space that the grid outlined by default but the grid would flex to accommodate the image. I then added overflow:hidden; to try and force the image to lose adapt to the cell size but I couldn't figure out it. I ended up using chatGPT to write code that kind of works but I don't like it.
TO DO:
Make the structure of the form to have a general sense of spacing. I should also consider writing up a workflow and template so I have a plan instead of moving from one thing to the next naturally. It leaves room for mistakes later in the project.

I broke down the website into thirds and imported the sidebar image.
To Do:
I'll need to use the two right most columns to place to form in and make sure that they don't stretch the sidebar image but layers overtop I think.
