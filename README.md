# signUpForm

17/2/2023:
I struggled to fit a very large image into the sidebar of the page. I wanted it to take up the space that the grid outlined by default but the grid would flex to accommodate the image. I then added overflow:hidden; to try and force the image to lose adapt to the cell size but I couldn't figure out it. I ended up using chatGPT to write code that kind of works but I don't like it.
TO DO:
Make the structure of the form to have a general sense of spacing. I should also consider writing up a workflow and template so I have a plan instead of moving from one thing to the next naturally. It leaves room for mistakes later in the project.

I broke down the website into thirds and imported the sidebar image.
To Do:
I'll need to use the two right most columns to place to form in and make sure that they don't stretch the sidebar image but layers overtop I think.
